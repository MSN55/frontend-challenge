first challenge for me
## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges I faced during this project was organizing and styling the layout using media queries for responsive design. Additionally, I had some difficulties aligning and positioning elements properly within the layout.

To overcome these challenges, I explored several frontend frameworks and resources available online, which helped me understand better approaches to solve the issues. This experience improved my understanding of responsive design and layout techniques.

I also used fonts from Google Fonts to match the design requirements more accurately. For precise layout dimensions and spacing, I relied on Photoshop to measure and replicate the original design as closely as possible.
